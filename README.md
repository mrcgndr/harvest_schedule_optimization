## Harvest schedule optimization with evolutionary algorithms

Due to copyright restrictions, the [Dataset](data/) in this directory is not exactly the dataset used in the paper but has the same characteristics.

GDU prediction is pre-executed due to long computation time.

* [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains Python dependencies (tested with Python 3.9.6)

Following scripts are included
* [hs_opt.py](hs_opt.py) performs the optimization procedure with our proposed method
* [moo_compare.py](moo_compare.py) performs the comparison between our method and NSGA-II and MOEA/D optimization
